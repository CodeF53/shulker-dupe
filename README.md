# shulker-dupe
A client-side fabric mod that makes it easier to perform the shulker dupe.

# Notes

---

Every dupe action ('Dupe All' and 'Dupe') depends on your ping and may not always work correctly.

The 'Dupe' button will always dupe the item in the first shulker box slot. (slot id 0)

All actions are found in the shulker box screen.

This is NOT an official mojang project.

This is a fork of the project where all the dupe buttons are binded to keybinds\
Ctrl + D = Dupe one item\
Ctrl + Shift + D = Dupe all items\
Shift + D = Dupe all items

_yes there's 2 keybinds for duping all items cause me and my friends couldn't decide which one to use_

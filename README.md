# shulker-dupe
A client-side fabric mod that makes it easier to perform the shulker dupe.

-- Notes:

The 'dupe all' option will not always dupe all the items in the shulker box.

The 'dupe' option will always dupe the item in the first shulker box slot. (slot id 0)

--- All of the options can be found in the shulker box screen.

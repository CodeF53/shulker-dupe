# shulker-dupe
A client-side fabric mod that makes it easier to perform the shulker dupe.

# Notes

---

Every dupe action ('Dupe All' and 'Dupe') depends on your ping and may not always work correctly.

This is a fork of the project where all the dupe buttons are binded to keybinds\
Ctrl + D = Dupe one item\
Ctrl + Shift + D = Dupe all items\
Shift + D = Dupe all items

Note: Duping one item would always dupe the item in the first shulker box slot. (slot id 0)

_yes there's 2 keybinds for duping all items cause me and my friends couldn't decide which one to use_

This is NOT an official mojang project.
